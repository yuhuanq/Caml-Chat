Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
A customizable terminal based XMPP client/server system that provides basic
messaging, and functionality expected of an IM application, as well as additional
features such as small interactive games between users/groups.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Summary</A>
</H1>

<P>
We intend to build a instant messaging client/server application implementing
the XMPP protocol using ANSIterminal, and XML OCaml packages. There will be a
central server to which users send requests to join a certain chat room, message
a certain person, be paired with a random person or even talk to an AI/Bot. They
will then be able to send formatted text messages to the room/person. Some other
extended features are detailed in the list below. A key innovative feature of
our messenger application is that users have the ability to socialize with each
other not only through text but also by playing small games with each other like
Tic-Tac-Toe or Rock-Paper-Scissors. There will also be some customizable aspects
to our messenger client, such as keybindings.

<P>

            up with a random person who is online or directly message another
            user. They can also join a chat room from a list of available chat
            rooms that are topic-based or interest-based to have a group chat.
